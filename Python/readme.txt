 quickly cover what I said. Today's presentation is reliability first alert in RCA. The purposes to collect the lessons learned from incidents and lock prominent failures and put efforts on finding the root causes. We know knowledge sharing is an I-Co value so it justifies collecting first reliability alerts as well. And just for your knowledge, it is a similar process to HSC incident alerts which the HSC team follows to capture and to dig deeper in their incidents. The liability incident accountability looks like this within two weeks everything happens within two weeks and it starts with the production losses and then more than 24 hours equivalent down times are captured either there are single incident or a combination of them. Incidents with the same with similar reasons. Step one is the issuing reliability first alert. The second step is scheduling, you know sharing the reliability first alert with everyone in our global meeting. The third step is completing and executing root cause analysis that I will explain a little bit later and collecting information from subject matter experts and the facts. Around the incident, grading the war document related to this which is a comprehensive reliable which shows and reflects the comprehensive reliability. Root cause analysis and the last step would be sharing that with the senior management. The information comes from ProDAC. Screen shot of how a product links for I-Co grant them look like. Graphic queries quality control management, Lansing Information Center report generator, which I regularly rules to capture information regarding the hour losses and the KPI management and scheduler at the end. So, we have a lot of technologies how time is defined in our investigation the total time available time non-ascigil plan production time, which we focus on that the running time and the machinery failure and stuff. We are not interested in slow speed at this moment because it is a little bit complex to calculate and has its own formula. So, the major focuses on machinery failure mechanical electrical operator and equipment line stoppage regarding the quantities of the maximum output target output the actual which comprises of the good output and seconds. So, the seconds are of inferior product, but they are not discarded and disposed. So, they have a little bit less quality. I exactly am not aware of the criteria to differentiate this, but this is how it looks like. OEE is a very prominent figure and indicator for most of the manufacturing plants. The standard definition is availability performance and quality multiplications, but in our system performances defined as the speed efficiency. So, the speed efficiency is you can see the formula where the formula how the formula looks like, which is the good output, but seconds in the way still divided by the product standard rate multiplied by run time. Product standard rate comes from the table which shows the KPI management. I will show you in a minute. So, the availability is clear and quality rate also is defined as the good output divided by good plus seconds and weights. So, this is how our OEE looks like. Down time, product creates a record each time one of the machines on the line stops producing product defines one of the line zones as the line down time zone. So, our downtime is defined by the quarter downtime. So, quarter downtime determines the downtime for the planet. And whenever a downtime it cares it records includes a duration of downtime and if possible, and available the reason will be captured from PLC automatically. If this non-production reason is not available, so it is the operators or the lead hand responsibility to enter the downtime reason. So, there is like dry matte cooling section finished product loop per laminator three-tap cutter are as blaming zones and will be assigned as the downtime soon. With when the quarter stops. So, the downtime percentage is line down time divided by the plan production downtime. What is long, line down time it is equal to machinery failure and stop. Our focus in the assessments on the technology and plants is on these plants. So, granule, isomot, shingeline, tpl are monitored every week. And for their downtime to see if they have any more than 24 hours downtime. Previously, the focus was on shingeline, but now it's been a few weeks that we included granules, isomot and tpl as you can see in this. This is just one sample line of downtime report from kenkeke. So, you can see the line zone, non-production group, start time, end time duration, line speed. Bondel's lost, what is the definition of the Bondel's lost? It has a formula, the hours lost, which is related to the duration, and it turns of hours and the decimal part that shows the minutes of full hour. So, the blame zone and blame machine and blame component and the reason name and the comments. So, all these comments are read by myself or by the co-op student that helps me to see how we need to consolidate downtime most probably. And also based on other indicators like blame zone and blame machine. This is how sample management KPI looks like, for example, for week 2023 for kenkeke and I have put them in boxes. The correlates, items that correlate with each other. You can see the production seconds and waste and also the availability and the downtime, which is broken down the total downtime to operator operational mechanical, electrical changeover, raw material, utility and other downtime. We are more focused on the top three, which is operational mechanical and electric. A few weeks back, until a few weeks back, we were pulling the information from Pro-Dac manually by creating these settings for each site. So, it was a little bit time consuming for all the plans to do this for capturing the management KPI from Pro-Dac. And this is the settings for pulling information from a report generator from Pro-Dac to capture our losses. But now we discussed this with the product team and all of this have been automated. So, every Monday I received the automated emails from Pro-Dac team that includes all the management KPI's plus the our losses. So, I would like to show you how this looks like. This is the management KPI in Excel format. And this one is the our losses that I showed you a sample line in the previous slide. Okay, so we put together all these down times and the search for more than 24 hours down time either as a single incident or combined. So, for Shingel line, we have a macro that searches for single incident and multiple incident and put that together. And if you have a backlog of so many down times, it would be a little bit difficult and time consuming to go through that to see if you can capture similar reasons and put them together and then see if it exceeds more than 24 hours. But now that we are doing this on a weekly basis, I don't feel need to get this process automated. It doesn't seem very essential and necessary because the operator attain expertise and can follow through and see even multiple incidents in one sheet and this expertise kind of make us independent. So, this is now being done manually to capture this more than 20 or hours incident. So, all our analysis and output will be fed to as a second it's uploading. Okay, so if you would like to find the final output of. More than 24 hours and first reliability first alert, you can go to reliability on page reliability publish downtime and downtime analysis and click on this link or I can provide you with the direct link to the spreadsheet. So, let's look how the final spreadsheet looks like. When you check the 24 hours looking for 24 hours, you check every week the downtime and every Monday we receive the automated emails from the for the week before. So, we go through it categorize them and search for more than 20. You really, you'll be able to have a 24 hours. You can see their weekly OED drop at least 20% on average level and you can use that indicator. If you don't have the OE drop significantly, you don't have to look at it. If you just want to isolate the 24 hours looking for a wee suddenly drop. Okay, because for example, if they're 70 and another week 50%. Okay, there must be a 24 hours sometime there. Otherwise, if it's keep 70 80% OE. There cannot be a 24 hours. No way. Right? No way. So, if they have 24 hours downtime and if they're OE drop like 20 30% that means they have something to get. I will say that conceivious and time if the OE is good. They don't even look at the 24 hours. You will not find it. Okay, yeah, but if OE drop like you know, before average and they have 70 75 and then this week 40 50. There's possibilities they have a 24 hour downtime or two. hours done. Yeah, that looks to be that can save you. Yes, every week. I don't know how much time. Well, student to work on them get this keep going. You need someone keep monitoring it. Right. That's I'm consuming. It's effort. So, if you go, it's just to identify Tony girls and one other thing to help is to check the OE. If there are OE in law, you look for it. If not, OE like normal, they are okay. Okay, yeah, I'm sorry that seems reasonable. That's good insight. Ellen, thank you. Yeah, that was very good. This is how the spreadsheet looks like. So, the week is a specified the manufacturing director's name, the plants. The week is a specified manufacturing director plant production line technology and the grooved by comments, the duration. Blame zone. And I want to draw your attention to these three lines. These three columns show the products that we are waiting for. So, the first product from the plant is the power point for the reliability. First of all, the second one is the extended RCA and the third one is the final presentation. So, if we receive any documents, we'll share that will put that on the SharePoint and drop the link in the corresponding cell. Everything is attainable and can be monitored with everyone, any management level or any corporate guy if they want to search and find the do any filtering based on year based on week or other parameters. And the year also who we followed up with on this matter. So, even Ellen, when we find the more than 24 hours, we don't put it on this list. We verify that we're the plan to make sure it is a true. We have caught the right more than 24 hours. So, we. I will let you know in a second, absolutely. We'll give them one week. So, column P. He shows this. If yes, means they have come back to us with an answer. If, if no, we will not put anything here. And if n y, it means we have communicated with them, but they have not come back at once. So, n y shows that you have not heard back from them. But already, you know, there is another way to do this. There is a, we have not received any product or any output from the planters. But yeah, this is how I. We handle this. And also the column Q and column R shows the problems captured. If it's a single incident, there would be one problem or it's a combination of two or more. And then we'll list them in column Q and R. And column S to W are, I think, Jonathan's. Or creating visual representation of all of these elephants. So, the sliders are based on manufacturing director technology and plant. So we can do any combination of searches to see it graphically how it looks like. One tab is for 2023, one tab for 2022 and a summary combined. Also available. And if you, for example, want to drill down on any of this entries, you can double click on any of these cells. And it will take you, for example, for I co-brampton, it will take you directly to the detailed information of. Down times from I co-brand. So you have access to all the information needed to dig deeper on any of the any plants down time. So either graphical and tabulated. This is how the final report looks like. Okay. Back to the root cause analysis. I'm going this. Probably only focusing on 34 hour emails. Then we know that. That's it's for the year. They could be smaller events like one hour, two hour events age. They just have a very critical. We want to of course over here. And they amount to less than more than a hundred hours of time. I need to really get the whole year. Shouldn't that be a lot of progress? For a little time. What we have been requested from the management is in a weekly time frame. And more than 24 hours previously, I was capturing more than eight hours weekly, more than eight hours. But later on the focus. Was on more than 24 hours. One of the reasons is that. To my understanding the meetings we have will Lewis and everyone. Samson. Creating a decent root cause analysis document. Is cumbersome. It's not very easy. And if we put a lot of if we ask the plans for. To do many root cause analysis. Probably they will not be able to do that. Not what many of you. This lead time period will result in many of you. But if we take a time period of the whole year. Then there are like 12, 2 or 3. This cross the most modern time in the previous year. The shoot. Children that we also have. The rather than just knowing a dog to. And we. What would be the frequency of. More than 24 hours down time in the division. The. Because 24 hours down time wouldn't be as frequent as we nothing. Water. We have a. Yeah, you can. As what Naveet says, you can. And then we have a lot of people. And then we have a lot of people. Have various combinations. Look at this monthly. 24 hours in a month. Or annually. Or weekly. But. This. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It can be. Not necessarily 24 hours. 24 hours events is. So looking at something. And you. Because if you have frequent. And then I happen to have a. You have five sheep right through the. In a shift. No, but. You have a lot of. But it is a looking for something. And you happen and try to prevent it across those sites. That's the main purpose of this. You hold word alert. It means that you're alerting the other plants. About a possibility of this. You have. Yeah. So that was awful. But that's really good. Given that respect... Just to creva... This game. Adam, that was? Yes, because it was a territory to me. If youLooking at Teamit Shopee wearing the object from your Doant chat. But. But it gets it. You can leave. A big time. We have because if they have things similar. You have 24 hours here. You know, on the same same person It's not towards what you are talking of is more of an improvement to get wearing you Do a character on the Mississippi and all that thing. This is not what this These alerts are leading towards our effort to do the brutal noises. Well, do the class and it's done by the plan. Yeah, I mean, we are only done by the plan, but it's only doing good for the medicine on the alerts. On the alert. On the alert. The plan also to the months will be helped too as well. And it's different. So the flops are also doing the They will be free top three. Top three. Yeah. And then they are not actually. They basically report the emergency case. Everything every week to was my cash. Okay. Yeah. Currently, I'm receiving many emails. Every week that Lewis forward to us for the weekly top three. From all the plans. So at the plant level, they are doing other root cause analysis. But this is what we What corporate at corporate level, we're following up on that at this moment. And try and share it with everyone. And I believe this will help. This will help. Establishing the methods. Teaching the plants. How to do a correct root cause Analysis. Because I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Because it's easier set than done. That do a root cause analysis. It's not very easy. So going through different techniques as time consuming needs insight into the technique. So this provides the opportunity to elevate and raise their knowledge on doing their own at plant level root cause analysis. That's my understanding. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a question for you. Why 24 hours? Like just before it's eight hours now, there are cost. They're activity with balance. Like we have your stuff in place. The answer is that people are dealing with data. People were not doing so. At least 24 hours. They might be producing the number of things. It was a. A kind of a random number that was a lot of good. I think that's right. When we started with 10 hours, we said no, that might be too many. Incidents. So let's stretch it out to 24. 24 is very few. We might not get very many, but let's start there. And that's so that's where it's been for the past couple of years. Okay. The root cause analysis. Let me. A little bit slow. Okay. And this is slide. You see the failure pyramid. Why it is pyramid? Because it shows level different levels of failure. And you may be familiar with all these concepts. What. I. I mean, I think that's right. I think that's right. And I think that's right. I think that is right. I think that is right. And I think that's right. So this is the first time that we have just a couple of different levels of failure. Why it is pyramid? Because we have more. For example, level of level. One compared to level four. You may have 10 20. Pre failure conditions. So, so. On the left side, you can see an example for this. So. Let's start with level one. The level one. Pre failure conditions. Like for pump. Say. Okay. So pump. Missile. I'm an imbalance. At this level, the corresponding. Strategy to address is predictive and proactive. At level two, the hidden failures. The example would be the pump bearing defect. So what is the corresponding maintenance strategy? Preventive and predictive to capture that at this level. Level three, the component failure or minor failure. What is the example leaking? What is still delivering the corresponding capacity for that pump? So the pump is leaking. But if it's a little bit of a bit of a. It's leaking. But if it's supposed to deliver 1000 gallon per minute, it is still delivering that. So this is a minor failure. At this level, the corresponding maintenance strategy is preventive. And the. Final. The functional failure is that a pump is supposed to deliver 1000 gallon per minute. And it is not able to do that. So this is run to failure. We want to prevent this by improving our procedures and maintenance strategies to avoid this to avoid run to failure. So a quick look at the PNF care shows where these strategies fall in the PNF care. Okay. So, that's what we're using. And vetoes. So the next question is, what are the techniques that we're using? And I will show you in our document. Is following cause and effect is using. We are using compare and contrast or. In some textbooks they call it the change analysis. And the change in the sequence. How in chronological order the sequences have taken place and how they're related. In a causal way. The problem and solution plus the description is. The first method we are using and our document is called investigating the failure. And is kind of in storytelling procedure. Whatever technique we are using. We need to ensure these six criteria. That to be certain that this. RCA is an effective RCA clearly defined the problem. And it's significance to the problem owner clearly delineate or portrait the known causal relationship. That combined to cause the problem. Clearly established causal relationship between the root cause and the original defined problem. Clearly present evidence used to support the existence of these causes. And clearly explain how the solutions will prevent the recurrence of the defined problem. And the last. Would be clearly document criteria one to five and such a way that everyone can easily understand the logic of the analysis. So whatever technique you'd be using or the plant will be using. We can audit that this way while looking into this criteria. I would just add one more. You get six of your. Please sir. Because many times when we said we went recurrence of the defined problem. It's not that easy to pivot. Because we're going to go into a design change and change. Modications or water. We can mitigate the effect of failure. That means if. Let's say. We are monitoring the very. And we catch that different before it will and so. You'll be cost of catastrophe. Will your hand get out and off. So it seems mitigation of failure and not. We necessarily begin to mention. You mentioned it's difficult. Time consuming it may or may not. If feasible. Well, no, my colleague as well. But mitigation is what we do. What typically call as limited. He is. Basically we inspect time. That to find out if there is any fault. There is any problem. Yes, I mean, absolutely. That's why I. I mentioned this that we want to. Yeah, if this level. Not avoiding reaching this level. And capturing the. Defining preventive or preventive predictive or consecutive. Provetted. To move down this. To run. Yes, I'm talking about trying to figure. You. In minute cases that is a solution. It's not because it's not a solution. It is the solution because. There are certain types of failures which you just cannot detect or. Like electronic components for example. You are not able to monitor it and it can feel anytime. Means. I'll call it around. So that is the run to failure. It's a known strategy that we cannot. So the only way you can mitigate is. To have a spare. You are. You are. So that is. Yes, you just witnessed it. Right. Yeah. Yeah, many parts fail randomly. So there's no. No effect in the strategy. Get a spare. It's special with some electrical. Oh, we done the system. Yeah, we don't insist. Yeah. Okay, just a second. Loading. Okay, there are two documents that I want to show you. One of them is the guideline that we have. This describes and lays out the failure investigation starts with purpose scope responsibilities. I've highlighted the responsibility of the reliability engineer, which is the failure investigation facilitator elaborated on this. And the records. So the purpose is to improve the work. SWIs and PMs to avoid the failures. Procedure is how to how to implement the investigation. The failure investigation is responsible for interviewing. Now that this is corresponding to your question. The failure investigation facilitator responsibilities for interviewing people who have. been in the process of the investigation. Who may know about the history and probable causes for adoption and maintenance personnel must be interviewed as well. How we are doing the follow ups and the methods. The methods we are using are the six method. As I said, the first one is the storytelling. From inception to completion of the failure. And the sequence of events. Either in a numbering order or a chronological order where. Including the cause of relationship between causes and effects. The five wide method which is a simplistic method used everywhere. And for. Kind of simple root cause analysis and the first step. The comparison and contrast and changes in differences, which is the change analysis. Or using visual. Cause and effect analysis. The last two methods are. Fall within that category. The fishbone diagram and cause effect map. So out of all of this we are capturing the possible causes. And then. With it's our responsibility to prove and disprove them. By testing them and also identifying in the last step. The most probable causes. And usually as Lewis has mentioned multiple times. It is not just a single root cause. It may be. Multiple root causes. And then we have to document this. So this is the guideline. The second document is. The template that will. Help the plants how to use this and step by step. The method one to. From the storytelling or failure investigation report to. O. Attaching photos. Everything I will show you some examples as well. The five white method to the method three sequence of events. How it looks like the method for how is. Fishbone diagram or Ishikawa. Diagram implemented. And the method one to the method one to the method one to the method one. And then the method one to the method one to the method one. Compare is an in contrast. What is the logic behind it and how you can implement it. So. And finally the cause map. Which is used in conjunction with five why. And both. The Ishikawa as well. In conjunction with five why to capture the root causes. The Statement one isitone code.Burkin one is one. And one is G Megan ahhra Anderson. A digital data management system does not mean a, like an interest.ULL The also idea. And the reason why we don't just use one is because, you know, just because you have a hammer in your toolbox doesn't mean that every single application is a nail. Okay. You can't hammer your problems away. In every case. And what. What naturally happens in a, a, root cause analysis investigation no matter what tool you use. The natural human behavior. I've seen many, many times and I've done over a hundred of these. Is you come up with somebody comes up with a new discovery. You know, they say, Oh, okay. The nut was loose. Ah, okay. That was it. A germ. Let's leave. We found the root cause. Wow. That was easy. Let's, let's go celebrate. Okay. That's. I'd say 80 75% of the time. That's the case. They find something and they say, Oh, we found it. Let's, that's it. You know, and then they don't pursue further and they, that that may. There's, there's a 95% of the time. It's, it's a combination of things, but, with, you have to look through that combination and find the ones that contributed the most. And then then that's why you have the different techniques that we don't say. We don't say, okay. Use this technique to solve the problem. Each of these six techniques that you see, they'll start off with a problem statement. And then, in the end, you get a possible cause. Every one of them. The outcome is a possible cause. The outcome is not the, the final smoking gun root cause. It's a possible cause. And then that's why at the end, you come up with how do you prove or disprove all of these possible causes that you use different techniques to find. It's just like if you. If, and I always compare it to a serial killer detective, you know, you're a detective and you're trying to find out who the serial killer is. And as, and so you, you find some suspects and as soon as you find someone who is. Who writes left handed and and where's a size 12 shoe, because they left a. A note and a footprint, then you say, okay, well, that's a killer, you know, it's not, you know, there's more things than that. And so that's why we develop multiple possible causes to be able to prove or disprove in the end, the most probable ones. And we list them by probability. So, but so that's the reasoning behind the multiple ones and why we call it possible causes before we call them final root causes. Yeah, absolutely. So, we do is along the same line that what you said, I prepared a slide that none of these techniques are 100% and bulletproof. So, I mentioned in this slide, why fishbone diagram is not perfect, why, why is not perfect and why change analysis is not perfect. So, experts in the area of root cause analysis recommend using more than one technique for doing at least two techniques to do root cause analysis. And this is I captured this, for example, from documents from Kentucky Center of NASA that shows the value of how compares different methods and tools of RCA. And if it's yes, the score is one, if it's limited, the score is 0.5, if it's no, the score is zero. So, you can see how the different methods side by side get score regarding defining problem, defining all the known causes, providing causal path to root causes. The leniating evidences and explaining how solutions prevent recarances and easy to follow report. And this is a comparison for the mostly known techniques in the area of RCA, which proves that we need to use more than one technique to. Or to the best. All. Fall three looks to be. Yeah. High high high high school cause me. Yeah. Fall three is very similar to cause me. So, yeah, that was my presentation. Sorry if I rush through it, but yeah, there was a lot of. The most cause. There are different phases of allowing a D. All the way forward. And at each phase you can use a different methods depending upon what failure you are. For example, one is to first it. Do a brainstorming. That's where the. Which one. I don't know. It gives you leads. So, if it is. That's where it. I guess the leads from the fish bone. Each car. And you can do it. Pause map. I think it can give you possible. Failure modes and failure. And for the, but it still doesn't change. For the. Comparing contrast. Can. Part of need you to. More final area. If you compare and you see that. Where where did you find a difference alleviation. When that particular area. The division. That means that. Most likely area. Or. Please. Yes, right. So, know the comparison and contrast is very similar to kept. No, no, Samson's been through kept. No, Samson's been through kept. No, no, Samson's been through kept. No, no, no, no, no. And so the. Each. Each one is. Each methodology. Really. A fits some situations better than others. Like the comparison and contrast. If you have. One machine that is. Not working right and you don't know why. And it's. But you have another piece of equipment that is very similar. The same. That's operating well. And then when you start to look at the. You know the who what where when. What magnitude and. What the differences are. In those between those two. Two piece of equipment. The one that's running well and the one that's not running well. And. Then you look at the. At differences and then he changes in those differences. Then that will lead you to that. That the possible causes. So, you know that that. That tool that methodology fits. Though that situation best. You know better than a five. Why would or better than. It is power of diagram would. But you know, like I said, you know, we don't. Just keep one tool in the toolbox. We keep multiple ones for different applications. But one thing that I think I have it in that. The instructions there at the end. There's also some some follow through that. Must take place as part of the root cause analysis. Not only do we document, but we have to share it. And we have to. We have to. We have to. We have to store it in the right place. So. Whenever. Whenever we build up to. You know, Solid problem. Likely it's been a repeat problem over time. And it's been it's caused us to have to wear use. Square part. Let's say if it's a particular. Baring our gearbox. Let's say a gearbox has been filled with a. Small gearbox has been failing over and over every. It used to fail every six months. You know, or a year and now it's failing every month. And so the first thing that will happen in the background. That's not usually in a root cause analysis is someone to say, wow, this thing's failing every month. We better up the reorder quantity. And to make sure that we can. respond quickly. So, Storeome guy. He orders. You know, triple, the increases. The minimum order quantities so that we can keep it up. Keep up with it each month, you know, working ahead. And so we solved the problem. Normally nobody goes back and corrects it. Okay. And then so we're just sitting there reordering every month. triple of what we normally do. So. On these highly repetitive failures. That's the first thing that we have to look back on is. Let's correct the. Storeome reorder point. And reorder quantity. And then. And then the next thing is once we solve this problem. We've only solved it on paper. It has to prove itself. You know, over time. And then we have to. And then we have to. And then we have to prove itself. You know, over time. And then when when we've got that. Verify that it has gone beyond its monthly failure rate. And now it's gone back to a, you know, a year later every two year failure rate. Then then that or at least when you've proven that it's no longer failing every month. Then we need to make sure we document that in the. And then we need to. And then we need to. Equipment. FMA CA because that FMA CA has to stay alive. And what keeps it alive is all of these. a lot of these. We do to solve problems that this FMA CA. For that equipment may not have. So we have to make sure that it's updated in the FMA CA. And then if that if we identify a PM. Will Chal or606. And there's a imaging of more increased pressure feedback. That's aoulos one. Um, which is Mindi sake. I just want to type out the FMA. How much of it was returned in storage because those are the we are. But trying to find the root cause we are focusing only on one area as to why or. On that you were he surrounding conditions of that you might have contributed more down more to the downtime than the like for example. Not having the part would probably require 10 hours of your time getting procuring that part from. So the poker should be on. Having that part available or making sure that that part is available with the. Some relevant. Is the shooting has taken more than then. You have to make sure that the shooting guideline is available. But this. Spot of is seem to be secondary, but they could be primary. Mental futures to the downtime. The solutions should also make not just. It's bringing the reason why the problem is called most cost, but also why it will cost for the four hours. Right. Yeah, it's not just quantum or don't get. Yeah, not just trigger the problem is. Is the light will take 10 hours. So that's two. Many cases, the problem might be relatively minor, but just because you did. Have a bath or. I think he sized this having one more thing. Exactly. These two also. Okay, so for the first. Right now our engineers understand about the posters, the mechanism of the first alert. So for our engineer, for not real, what are their role in this person that process. The corporate engineers. Yes. So I think this is something I was then interested in. What their expectation what they. What's that role. I think initially the reliability engineer at the plant. They won't know what to do, even though we've given them instruction, even though we've given them. Talked about it. They may not necessarily know. And so the. You know, the corporate reliability representative needs to look at the backlog. You know, if they have two or three that haven't been done. They need to find out. Okay, what's keeping them from. Following the procedure. You know, this whole process. This was this 24 hour thing with the reliability first alert. That's this is not my idea. You know, this was geese idea. This wasn't the whites idea. This came directly from G. You know, and he is the one that. That has been pushing this since 2021. He's the one that's been driving it and setting up the rules and defer to follow the HSE. The first alert. So, you know, and, and we need to do everything we can to support it because he's, he's going through us to make it happen. So, but from our corporate without the engineer for the bill, we are trying to help the sites to be successful in these process. Yeah. So, since the problems that and they, we said, what the students, they, they find some of the. Is it the standing so for 24 hours. They will be sent and things will send out the email to the sites to verify that easily this video. On schedule, the time time for over 24 hours, right. So, I think that's the email will be also copied to the corporate without the engineer. That was what we do right now. So, that the, the corporate without the engineer will, will know about that incident for the sites that they are supporting. So, and the corporate without the engines should. And start helping for monitor over sync if the sites is doing what they supposed to do. So, if they are behind or something or having some problem in doing the RCA, I think we missed you for actively helping them to, to, to, to work on. So, we're going to have to have them to fall off and to make sure that's where you will be able to submit the RCA request on the first on the PPT. And then so the RCA PPT and then nature ones to set up the meeting with key to do the presentation. First and last part are quite a straightforward. The first reliably first lift PowerPoint is very self-explanatory, as you can see one example on the left side. So, the, the, the cumbersome and challenging part would be to do the root cause analysis selecting the right technique. So, the first part, even though the first part for the PPT, we just to make sure that they feel out this form of a need. To fill out each form probably is the aspects do have they defined the lowest level, chow. Do they have the world or the number over there. So, so this is, this may not be able to see they may, they didn't pass. They are not feeling in correctly. They are missing the asset. They are missing the, the, the, the thing about it and incident as big as sorting down the, the nine for 20 or four hours. They don't even have a world order. So, so that is it won't happen in the past, but way longer where we are helping them to do it properly. These are the things that are really interesting. Also making sure that they are doing it. Correct. And they, if they don't know how to do it, and then we list why the support. Thanks. And I think, I think you brought up a very good question. What, what is the responsibility of the corporate reliability rep. I think the first thing is when we do know that there's a 24 hour issue that they, they, and they submit it, they, they may send that reliability first alert to the corporate reliability rep, because they don't know how we're to get the distribution list. So we can, you know, so the, our, our, the corporate reliability rep and send it to me some, be some consented to the distribution list and that's global. And then, and then the second thing is the, they know they have two weeks to finish the investigation. And that corporate reliability rep can help to make sure that, that at least they give them the guidelines and, and, you know, and, and get them ready to review it on the global reliability, go to meeting. And just like PJ two weeks ago, he shared the, the decline of the DMA accumulators and the were the roles that fallen due to that counter weight getting caught. And then, and he boiled down, you know, basically to a bolt that came loose. And, you know, for him to share it was important because that whenever we talk loose bolts, we should think Nordic wedge lock washer, you know, and that will prevent that 98% of our, our vibrate, our bolts at vibrate loose bolts and nuts. And so by sharing that, you know, he gets other input from other people incorporate and with other plants so that they can, they can have a more thorough consideration for possible cause and solutions. So the number one is, you know, get the get that reliability first alert notification make sure it's filled out properly like you said get that over to me some for distribution and then get them on the call schedule them for the call and then make sure that they're already started their investigation. And then, and then set up a meeting with myself, me some and the corporate reliability rep in the reliability engineer to make sure that his findings are thorough. And then schedule that meeting with Dwight and Guy. One thing one thing is, when we, when we feel that reliability analyzes right we can all come to the similar root cost right but there is a something to feel is a corrective action. And that can be that's something that we may have different opinion. When we do the root cause analyzes we always come to the same we always finally agree with the root cause. But how to solve the root cause could be a lot of area that's a. And variable there, for example, you can you can put a lot of now washers, you can put the anti or quarter pins you can weld it on there. So some of overkill some of it's or you can check every day weekly right it's all different solutions this one. And the iPhone is is hard to to fund you have to fund agreement with the plan what they like to do what is convenient because the same thing same root cause but prevent you can have 10 different kind of solution that's not only one unit and. And sometimes the plan choose this one instead of another one right so this is one part that because I remember I have one time is like the actual spill in the. And be be eight the mixer right we give them a lot of suggestion we only give them recommendation which one they choose you can you can you can overkill it or you can do not enough that's one part that. And so we need some there's some room to pay over there that's when we when we come to that situation that's a good point Alan and that's why. Whenever we come up with corrective actions. Those are the corrective actions that were a thought of or selected at the time and that don't necessarily solve the problem but time. We'll tell and that's why if if we had a spill you know every two months and then now you know we haven't had a spill in past two months three months for months, then we know that we've solved it. If if we see that oh you know it's not to but now it's three and now we're having spills every three months so so the the proof of it in the field that corrective action. We'll require follow it because just because we developed schedule and a corrective action does not mean we solve the problem. It just it just means that we've put thought into it we've collected what information we could at the time and that's that's the solution that we developed. At that time and that may not be a fully encompassing solution you know it may require additional mitigation it may require adjustment to get right frequency and other corrective actions that were recommended. So yes we may not hit it right the first time but you know it it part of this process means that it will require follow up you know to verify that that corrective action and the frequency was was correct and eliminated not only the. And the litmus test is is is is our corrective actions and the frequency that we do it at are the PMs did has it eliminated the symptoms. That's why symptoms are an important part of the investigation because that's the test that you use to prove or disprove it in the end. So if we're still having symptoms that we showed before then we haven't really got to the root cause yet. Okay, thank you Lewis so I think we are all around 30 minutes over time so if you have any questions or we can close out this meeting. Yeah, very good lunch and learn I didn't see any emoji of your. Back there the smacking lips. That sounds good. Thank you Lewis thank you Dawson. Thank you very much. What's this the background with food. Our meeting so. Sorry about. More hungry. Good meeting. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.
